# Components

## Required shared CSS classes

Build agents should use these shared classes before inventing new visual patterns:

```text
skip-link
app-header
app-header__inner
app-identity
app-logo
app-icon
app-card__icon
app-title
app-subtitle
app-title-copy
app-menu-toggle
app-nav
app-main
app-footer
app-feedback
app-page-heading
app-card
app-toolbar
app-actions
app-alert
app-alert--info
app-alert--success
app-alert--warning
app-alert--danger
app-badge
app-status
app-empty
app-table-wrap
app-form-grid
app-field
app-required
app-error
app-help-text
heading-anchor
docs-toc
```

Directory cards place a meaningful icon before their content and make the card's `h3` text the destination link. Do not add a second "Open …" link.

Documentation pages add hover/focus anchor links to content headings and use `aria-current="location"` to highlight the section currently in view in the "On this page" navigation.

## The `.menu` disclosure component

`.menu` / `.menu-toggle` / `.menu-panel` is the shared pattern for any click-to-open dropdown: the MarinOS banner (see `app-shell.md`), and grouped document actions (Share, Download) described in `accessibility-implementation.md`. It is a disclosure pattern (a toggle button plus a hidden panel), not a full ARIA `menu`/`menuitem` widget — that keeps keyboard support simple (Tab reaches the toggle and, once open, the panel's real links/buttons in order; Escape closes and returns focus to the toggle) and avoids the roving-tabindex and arrow-key requirements that `role="menu"` would demand.

```html
<div class="menu">
  <button type="button" class="menu-toggle" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="example-panel">
    Label
    <svg class="menu-toggle__caret" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="M4 6l4 4 4-4"/></svg>
  </button>
  <div id="example-panel" class="menu-panel" hidden>
    <a href="...">Option one</a>
    <button type="button">Option two</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

`app-shell.js` wires up every `.menu` on the page generically: click toggles the panel (and closes any other open menu), clicking a link/button inside the panel closes it, clicking outside closes it, and Escape closes it and returns focus to the toggle. No per-page JavaScript is needed beyond that shared behavior. Give the toggle a second class (`marinos-menu__toggle`, or `doc-action` for a pill-styled action button) to skin it for its context — `.menu-toggle` itself only supplies layout, not visual style.

## Shared CSS implementation

`shared/app-brand.css` is the executable source of truth. Do not copy a second CSS implementation into this specification. Consumers must vendor the complete versioned bundle and record the installed release in `BRAND_VERSION`.

The shared CSS must include OS-controlled light and dark tokens, the MarinOS banner, icon/title treatment, gold title-copy border, cards, text-only feedback button, Docs heading anchors, active table-of-contents state, responsive behavior, print behavior, visible focus, and reduced-motion handling.
